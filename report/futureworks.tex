\section{What we are going to do}
In this report we explained goals and current state of our work. First, we spent a lot of efforts in understanding the state of the art of parallel sorting by searching in books and papers. Once gathered sufficient informations, we designed a framework to address all the problems that would have been common to all our algorithms: e.g.: generation, loading and storing of data, timing, initialization of the MPI environment and so on. Keep in mind that, thanks to its modularity, we will be able to exploit the features of our framework for any new sorting algorithm we would like to implement. 

We have already implemented and tested all the algorithms we described. We have performed some tests on Pianosa, the cluster at our department, both to check the correct behavior of the algorithms and to start analyzing the performance. Some of the algorithms still needs some minor fixes for what concerns the implementation.

What are going to do in the next weeks:
\begin{itemize}
\item ultimating the implementation of the framework to handle huge data sets;
\item refining the implementation of the algorithms in order to fix some little bugs;
\item performing the same tests we run on pianosa on the ''Physics' cluster'';
\item analyzing both the scalability and the algorithm-efficiency of our algorithms;
\item checking (and understanding) for potential mismatches between the scalability obtained on Pianosa and the one on the ''Physics' cluster'';
\item writing a final version of this report.
\end{itemize}
