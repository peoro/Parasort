\section{Conclusions}
In this report we explained goals and current state of our work. First, we spent a lot of efforts in understanding the state of the art of parallel sorting by searching in books and papers. Once gathered sufficient informations, we designed a framework to address all the problems that would have been common to all our algorithms: e.g.: generation, loading and storing of data, timing, initialization of the MPI environment and so on. Keep in mind that, thanks to its modularity, we will be able to exploit the features of our framework for any new sorting algorithm we would like to implement. 

\subsection{Future Works}
\begin{itemize}
\item Asynchronous I/O to send \texttt{Data}. 
\item Dynamic approach within DAL.
\item Structuring the Sorting DAL layer.
\item Better implementation of the $DAL\_allowedBufSize$.
\item Measuring the DAL overhead for sorting data sets that can fit the primary memory.
\end{itemize}
