\subsection{Structuring by levels}
We designed a framework in such a way that all our algorithms can share a lot of specific features. In this context, it is useful to give a general view of our system by identifying and defining its abstraction levels. Figure~\ref{levels} shows the levels structure of the system. As we said, all the Sorting Algorithms exploit a framework that relies on top of MPI, in particular the primitive provided by the Data Abstraction Layer. The importance of the DAL is crucial: in this version of the report we will analyze the DAL, while we will describe all the features of the framework in its final version.
